     <br>AFCM 25th Anniversary Celebration Concert
     <br>by Helen Land</span>
   <img src="Barrier%20Reef%20Orchestra_files/AFCM01.jpg" alt="AFCM concert" border="0" vspace="5">    
    <span style="text-align:left; font-weight:normal; font-size:10pt; color:black;">
     <br><br>A very pleasant Sunday afternoon in Queens Gardens was 
attended by approximately three and half thousand satisfied music 
lovers. This free concert organised to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of
 the AFCM was also a fitting opportunity for BRO to celebrate its 15th 
Anniversary with it’s first ever outdoor public performance.
     <br><br>The tastes of all music lovers was satiated. The concert 
opened with the ceremonial and pompous Brass composition by Aaron 
Copland titled Fanfare for the Common Man, followed by the equally 
ceremonial Imperial March by William Walton. Genuine fun and musical 
camaraderie emanated from the performance by Camerata of St Johns with 
their virtuosic classical performance. In addition they ably accompanied
 Amy Dickson in her flawless saxophone performance with her distinctive 
tone clearly displaying the reason she is sought after around the world.
     <br><br>1RAR Big Band played to the high standard Townsville 
audiences are familiar. They had the audience tapping their feet to 
their musical and vocal compositions. Cheryl Barker’s powerful soprano 
rang across the park and most likely was heard on Castle Hill as she 
sang two arias accompanied by BRO and conducted by UK conductor Nicholas
 Daniel. 
     <br><br>The finale of the afternoon which included musicians from 
all three ensembles was the 1812 Overture. It was delightful to see the 
audience enthusiastically participate in this finale. This pleasant 
afternoon can only be rated as a huge success and may prove to be the 
first of many performances in years to come.

     <b>President’s Report </b>
     <br>for 2015 AGM North Queensland Ensembles Inc.
     <br></span>
     <span style="text-align:left; font-weight:normal; font-size:10pt; color:black;">
     <br>The Barrier Reef Orchestra is in a sound financial position with concert attendance and revenue from tickets up for 2013.
     <br><br>The Orchestra performed on six occasions over the last 12 
months.  This included a children’s concert at Riverway featuring music 
from Harry Potter and Peter and the Wolf.  The concert was well received
 by the audience and the Orchestra got into the mood by dressing up 
appropriately for their musical characters.
     <br><br>Masterworks conducted by Mark Sheills  and featuring the 
2013 Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition winner was performed in 
September with a  follow up  performance in the Burdekin. Sadly the 
Burdekin concert was not well attended despite the best efforts in 
advertising and extra signage.
     <br><br>Last Night of the Proms was performed in November and 
conducted by Richard McIntyre.  As expected the audience join in with 
the antics.
     <br><br>The new year saw the successful season launch at the Pier 
Restaurant and featured our new harp much to the enjoyment of those 
present.  The Mayor of Townsville, Councillor Jenny Hill, officially 
launched the 2015 season and spoke of the importance of the Barrier Reef
 Orchestra to Townsville.
Not long after that was Sounds of Romance conducted by Raymond Yong.  
The issue of parking problems were extreme and the matter was taken up 
with Council.  Hopefully there will not be a repeat performance.
     <br><br>The Orchestra was invited to open the Townsville Arts 
Awards with a cameo performance of the music from Frozen much to the 
audiences’ pleasure, particularly with the AV accompaniment.
The Barrier Reef Orchestra will conduct the second Conducting Workshop 
at the end of May as it was so successful in 2013.
     <br><br>For the rest of the year there is our support to the AFCM 
concert, our World Music Concert commissioned by the Civic Theatre (a 
first for BRO), support to DanceNorth with their Twilight performances 
and lastly a Musical Feast for November.
     <br><br>To make all of this happen there is a dynamic and committed
 committee working away to bring this all together.  I thank them all 
for their magnificent work.  My thanks also goes to our major sponsor 
the Townsville City Council, our generous benefactors and to the 
Orchestra Manager Sally Frewen-Lord who has found time to run a survey 
for the musicians to get some feedback on how we do business.  Thank you
 all.
     <br><br>Jeff Nielsen has reworked our website and taken great steps
 forward in producing a functional and relevant website.  Jeff is 
handing it over to the next person to continue the good work, Thanks 
Jeff.
I will be introducing life members later as a way of marking the Barrier
 Reef Orchestra 15th Anniversary.
     <br><br>The Barrier Reef Orchestra has taken the opportunity to be 
directly involved with the development of the TPAC proposal.  I see it 
as necessary support to all of the arts organisations to promote the 
need for more performance spaces in Townsville and I would urge you all 
to visit the website and help spread the word.  Simon has injected 
himself into this project with the usual eye for detail while keeping 
appraised of the macro developments in Townsville.  Thanks Simon for 
your energy and incisive views on this important project.
     <br><br>The 15th anniversary year of BRO has been marked by several
 approaches to the Orchestra to perform in support of other arts 
organisations.  I take this as a sign of confidence others see in our 
Orchestra and acceptance of the Barrier Reef Orchestra as Townsville’s 
resident cultural cornerstone to orchestral music.  A fitting milestone 
for the 15th year of the Barrier Reef Orchestra.
