		<h2>Pluses, Minuses and Interesting aspects of our teamwork process</h2>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<h3><strong>Pluses</strong></h3>
					<li>We were able to do our work with the Github as our only communication outside the classroom</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<h3><strong>Minuses</strong></h3>
					<li>We rarely communicated through email or other means outside the classroom</li>
					<li>We couldn't collaborate because, the timing around when the work was done didn't coincide</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<h3><strong>Interesting Aspects</strong></h3>
					<li>Tony - I don't like to work under time constraints as my work suffers because I would rather do the work early and improve it at my leasure</li>
					<li>Tony - I've noticed that Fin does good work even with time constraints evoked</li>
				</ul>
