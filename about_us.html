      <h2>History of the Orchestra</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="specialguests">
      <p class="ptop"> Over a two-year period in the late nineties, Townsville musicians, arts workers and a group of people who had a love for music realised the potential 
        for <span style="color:blue">developing a community-based Orchestra</span> — one that would flourish and become an integral part of the City’s cultural life.<br><br>
        <span style="color:blue">In 2000</span> to ‘test’ the viability of establishing an Orchestra a weekend workshop was arranged and musicians were invited to participate under the 
        baton of Richard McIntyre, Senior Lecturer at the Canberra School of Music and the result — <span style="color:blue">the Barrier Reef Orchestra was born</span>.<br><br>
        During the past few years, the Orchestra has performed with the comedy-duo Scared Weird Little Guys in Score, Townsville City Council’s Last Night 
        of the Proms and A Christmas Carol. <span style="color:blue">In 2003</span> the Council’s centenary year <span style="color:blue">the Orchestra took part in Encore</span>, as well as playing a major role in the 
        Townsville Civic Theatre’s 25th Anniversary productions of <span style="color:blue">Noye’s Fludde and Carmina Burana</span>.<br><br>
        <span style="color:blue">In a typical year the Barrier Reef Orchestra</span>, under the auspices of North Queensland Ensembles Inc, <span style="color:blue">performs three times</span> generally with a guest 
        conductor and occasionally with other performing groups. <span style="color:blue">Smaller ensembles</span>, all utilising players from the Orchestra, <span style="color:blue">regularly give concerts</span> — 
        Orpheus Strings, Pandanus Winds, Kingfisher Trio, Centenary Concert Band and the Barrier Reef Chamber Orchestra. In 2004, the Orchestra presented 
        its first subscription series of three concerts receiving <span style="color:blue">sponsorship from Queensland Nickel – Yabulu</span>.<br><br>
        The high standard is due in no small measure to the guidance and inspiration of our founding Patron, <span style="color:blue">Professor John Hopkins OBE and conductor 
        Richard McIntyre OAM</span>.<br><br>
        In 2006 the orchestra became a truly North Queensland orchestra when in March a number of string players from Cairns travelled to Townsville to 
        rehearse under <span style="color:blue">Professor Hopkins for the planned Tchaikovsky concert</span>. Unfortunately, the interruption of <span style="color:blue">Cyclone Larry</span> prevented the repeat 
        performance scheduled for Cairns.<br><br>
        The final concert for 2006 , <span style="color:blue">‘Amadeus’</span>, celebrated the life of this great composer in his 250th anniversary year. The Barrier Reef Orchestra could 
        think of no better way in which to celebrate their <span style="color:blue">sixth anniversary</span>! </p>
      <p class="pmid"> <strong>2007</strong><br>
        In 2007 BRO performed <span style="color:blue">the Beethoven Triple Concerto with visiting Seraphim Trio from Melbourne</span>. The orchestra repeated the concert in Cairns with 
        no Cyclone Larry this time!<br><br>
        A string ensemble drawn from the larger orchestra was invited by <span style="color:blue">Piers Lane</span> the new Director of the AFCM, to perform for the first time in the 
        <span style="color:blue">Australian Festival of Chamber Music</span>, accompanying <span style="color:blue">Australian Opera Baritone Peter Coleman-Wright</span>, a very successful concert.<br><br>
        The <span style="color:blue">Governor of Queensland</span> became the <span style="color:blue">patron</span> of the Orchestra joining the <span style="color:blue">founding patron Professor John Hopkins</span> to inspire the further development 
        of the orchestra and the year culminated in a sell out concert featuring <span style="color:blue">James Morrison, conductor Sean O"Boyle, jazz vocalist Emma Pask</span> and a 
        collaboration with <span style="color:blue">Townsville Brass</span> and the rythym section from the amazing <span style="color:blue">1 RAR Band</span>. The event of the year! </p>
      <p class="pmid"> <strong>2008</strong><br>
        In 2008 this last concert generated an award from the Townsville City Council as "<span style="color:blue">Best Musical Event 2007</span>" and after a mammoth launch at the 
        Townsville City Council Chambers the year began with a concert under the baton of visiting UK conductor <span style="color:blue">Mark Eager</span>. This was a collaboration with 
        a <span style="color:blue">combined High Schools orchestra</span> and demonstrated the depth of musical talent flowing up from the district's excellent Instrumental Music programs. 
        The concert culminated in BRO combining with the high school orchestra for a stirring <span style="color:blue">1812 Overture</span>!<br><br>
        Then followed a terrific concert featuring <span style="color:blue">Matthew Rigby, the 2007 winner of the North Queensland Concerto and Vocal Competition</span>, conducted by <span style="color:blue">John 
        Hopkins OBE</span>, continuing a fruitful collboration promoting young rising musicians.<br><br>
        This was closely followed by a 2008 performance at the AFCM with the orchestra ensemble playing a <span style="color:blue">Carl Vine composition "The Battlers"</span> which was 
        conducted by the composer.<br><br>
        Also at this occasion the orchestra accompanied Innisfail-born, London-based concert pianist <span style="color:blue">Piers Lane</span>. The orchestra greatly appreciates such 
        opportunities to perform alongside such inspiring artists.<br><br>
        Conductor <span style="color:blue">Richard McIntyre</span> returned with rising Oboist <span style="color:blue">Megan Billing</span> and BRO to perform in <span style="color:blue">Slavonic Swoon</span>, featuring works by <span style="color:blue">Dvorak, Smetana and 
        Martinu</span>.<br><br>
        2008 culminated in the return of <span style="color:blue">Sean O'Boyle</span> who brought with him <span style="color:blue">James Morrison, Emma Pask and Catherine Lynagh</span> (Qld Piano Competition winner) and 
        another collaboration with <span style="color:blue">1RAR musicians</span>. </p>
      <p class="pmid"> <strong>2009</strong><br>
        The Barrier Reef Orchestra proudly announced that Her Excellency, the <span style="color:blue">Governor of Queensland Penelope Wensley</span> agreed to be <span style="color:blue">patron</span> of our orchestra.<br>
        2009 was a year of highs and lows for the Barrier Reef Orchestra...<br><br>
        Our first concert in March was conducted by <span style="color:blue">Richard McIntyre</span> but we had pre-concert drama as our soloist had to retire due to injury. We fortunately 
        were able to get <span style="color:blue">Marcus Stocker</span> at the last minute to play the <span style="color:blue">Dvorak concerto</span>. The program of Dvorak and Sibelius challenged the orchestra but the 
        challenge and drama became greater due to the failure of the airconditioning at Riverway.<br><br>
        With the venue getting hotter and hotter during rehearsal we had to decide whether to go ahead or cancel the event. We decided to go ahead and most 
        of our loyal audience stayed with us but it was hard going. Rick who is from cold Canberra certainly got a feel of the tropics that night as did 
        everyone that attended.<br><br>
        Our mid year concert had to be cancelled due to the majority of the orchestra going away for a <span style="color:blue">music camp</span>. Very few cities the size of Townsville 
        attempt to produce an orchestra and while Townsville is musically very strong we certainly stretched the music fraternity too far at that time.<br><br>
        Our October concert was to <span style="color:blue">feature Ji Won Kim</span> who had <span style="color:blue">won</span> the previous <span style="color:blue">Australian Vocal and Concerto Competition</span> here in Townsville. However, her 
        blossoming career had her overseas at the time, and made her unavailable for that concert. She has since gone on to win the <span style="color:blue">ABC’s Young Performer of 
        the Year Award</span>. We now look forward to hearing her play in our next concert in March 2010.<br><br>
        Our guest conductor <span style="color:blue">Sean O’Boyle</span> knew the perfect singers to do a “<span style="color:blue">Last Night at the Proms</span>” concert. This concert was a great success! It <span style="color:blue">featured 
        the Townsville Oratorio Choir</span>, the full orchestra, <span style="color:blue">Sean O’Boyle</span> conducting and also included <span style="color:blue">guest piper, Ray Sutton, guest tenor, Gregory Moore and 
        Canadian soprano, Suzanne Kompass</span> at the Civic Theatre. </p>
      <p class="pmid"> <strong>2010</strong><br>
        As promised, <span style="color:blue">Ji Won Kim duly performed in our March Concert Romantic Interludes</span> at the Riverway Arts Centre. This well attended concert <span style="color:blue">featured 
        Beethoven Violin Concerto</span> with Ji Won giving a stunning performance. The concert also included <span style="color:blue">Schubert’s Rosamunde Overture and the “unfinished” 
        Symphony No. 8 by Schubert</span>. Conductor was <span style="color:blue">Professor John Hopkins</span>.<br><br>
        The string section of the Orchestra played at our <span style="color:blue">major sponsor Queensland Nickel’s Open Day</span> in May.<br>
        In July we celebrated our <span style="color:blue">10th anniversary</span> with a concert <span style="color:blue">conducted by Richard McIntyre</span> who also conducted the first Barrier Reef Orchestra ten years 
        ago. This was an afternoon tea concert with table settings of ten at <span style="color:blue">Jupiters Hotel Ballroom</span> with high tea served at interval. It was a mixed program 
        intended to suit the occasion with two pieces repeated from the first concert and highlighting the talents of nine local musicians as soloists 
        including <span style="color:blue">John Coulton from London on trumpet</span> (but as an ex Pimlico High Student still counted as local). This concert was extremely well received 
        and also included the distribution of the newly published <span style="color:blue">10 year commemorative history of the Orchestra prepared by Jean Dartnall</span>.<br><br>
        Our October concert featured the <span style="color:blue">2009 Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition winner Rebecca Chan</span>. It was <span style="color:blue">held at Dancenorth Studio with Professor 
        John Hopkins conducting</span>. Rebecca gave a memorable <span style="color:blue">performance of Mozart Violin Concerto No. 4 and Vaughn Williams Lark Assending</span>. The concert was at 
        5.0pm and <span style="color:blue">titled Twilight Classics</span> with a varied program including <span style="color:blue">Delibes, Elgar and Grainger</span>. An end of year BBQ followed for members and guests. 
        As special guest performers we also had <span style="color:blue">Pimlico Chamber Strings</span> who gave a short recital which demonstrated the talents that won them the <span style="color:blue">Queensland 
        Fanfare Award for 2010</span>. </p>
      <p class="pmid"> <strong>2011</strong><br>
        We have had a notable and rewarding year which saw the Orchestra include other arts groups to great advantage – <span style="color:blue">three choirs, 1RAR Band and Townsville 
        Cinema Group</span> were all <span style="color:blue">involved</span> with us this year. The three concerts attracted a total of 1,457 patrons and two were full houses.
        On Tuesday, 16th August the great <span style="color:blue">Beethoven 9th Symphony</span> was played at Townsville Civic Theatre with <span style="color:blue">Conductor David Lawrence and soloists from 
        Brisbane and Mackay and the Spirit of the Voice Choir</span>. A full house and a standing ovation. The young choristers of <span style="color:blue">Allegretto choirs</span> provided an 
        entertaining first half before many <span style="color:blue">proud parents and a receptive audience</span>, this concert was however all about Beethoven’s 9th and under the 
        enthusiastic, at times athletic, leadership of <span style="color:blue">British Conductor David Lawrence</span> the orchestra, soloists and the choir gave a dramatic performance.<br><br>
        The concert was a major musical and logistical challenge presenting this great work for the first time in Townsville (probably for the first time 
        anywhere in regional Australia). The concert attracted both new audience and new orchestra members and was a greatly rewarding experience for 
        performers and audience alike. It also <span style="color:blue">won the 2011 Performance of the Year trophy</span> at the Townsville City Council Arts Awards.<br><br>
        Our final concert had the Barrier Reef Orchestra <span style="color:blue">Going to the Movies</span> at Riverway Arts Centre. Orchestra Manager, Andrew Ryder was the originator and 
        Conductor and it featured members of the 1 RAR Band and visual images were organised by Townsville Cinema Group<br><br>
        A concert with a difference – <span style="color:blue">performed in semi- darkness</span> with both still and moving images projected to accompany the varied program of familiar and 
        memorable movie music. <span style="color:blue">Gabriel’s Oboe</span> was a highlight as was the <span style="color:blue">classic Tom and Jerry cartoon</span>. A very well received concert, also one that drew many 
        new faces.<br><br>
        March this year had a Russian theme and the sold out concert at Riverway was <span style="color:blue">conducted by our artistic patron, Richard McIntyre</span> and featured <span style="color:blue">2011 
        Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition winner Edwina George</span> playing the <span style="color:blue">Prokofiev Violin Concerto No. 2</span>. It also had a <span style="color:blue">small harp solo</span> played by a 
        special guest and international harpist <span style="color:blue">Sebastien Lipman</span> in the <span style="color:blue">Nutcraker Suite by Tchaikovsky</span>.<br><br>
        A bonus concert was a recent as this last week when the Orchestra played the <span style="color:blue">1812 Overture at the Kapyong Day Official Parade</span> along with the 1RAR Band 
        and <span style="color:blue">live cannons</span> at Lavarack Barracks.<br><br>
        In 2010 we appointed a paid part time manager; this has now run for two years and has proven most beneficial. Our first manager <span style="color:blue">Andrew Ryder</span> resigned 
        after the October concert due to other work commitments and he has been replaced by <span style="color:blue">Sally Frewen-Lord</span>. I wish to thank Andrew for his great 
        contribution to the year’s success.<br><br>
        Our publicity has improved over the year with both the presentation and numbers of posters and banners increasing. The use of <span style="color:blue">reuseable banners</span> 
        re-branded for each concert is proving to be a big saving. Another advance in 2011 was the <span style="color:blue">acquisition of music scores</span> and parts for a BRO repertoire. 
        When these pieces can be included in the rehearsal schedule we will have the ability to fill unforeseen performance opportunities on quite short 
        notice.<br><br>
        Sponsorship support in 2011 was excellent and combined with good box office numbers has enabled us to further build up our cash reserves which two 
        years ago were dangerously low.<br><br>
        <span style="color:blue">Queensland Nickle, Townsville City Council and the Wheeler Family Charitable Gift Fund</span> have all continued their <span style="color:blue">generous support</span> of our core 
        activities in 2011. Council funding was changed from an annual funding to a 3 year agreement.<br>
        Two concerts this year had “concert sponsors”. <span style="color:blue">RACQ sponsored the Beethoven 9th Symphony</span> concert and <span style="color:blue">RSL N.Q. District sponsored</span> the Barrier Reef Orchestra 
        <span style="color:blue">Goes to the Movies</span> concert. In both cases the respective organisation’s members received concession admission prices as part of the arrangement. <br>
        We were also supported during the year with cash or in <span style="color:blue">kind assistance from Kowari Motors, Signs of Excellence, ASAP Printers, Sturt Business Centre, 
        The Keyboard Shop and Pimlico State High School</span>.<br><br>
        <span style="color:blue">Grants</span> were received <span style="color:blue">from RADF and the Breakwater Island Casino Community Benefit Fund</span> – as well as the repertoire music mentioned before, the 
        Orchestra now have six adjustable cello chairs. Our sincere thanks go to all of our sponsors and we look forward to their continuing support. </p>
      <p class="pmid"> <strong>2012</strong><br>
        2012 was a very successful year for the orchestra. We presented three concerts, one at Riverway Arts Centre and two at the Civic Theatre. Each was 
        well received and well patronized – a total of 1,434 patrons between the three concerts. Not only is our <span style="color:blue">audience increasing</span> but so also is the 
        <span style="color:blue">orchestra increasing</span> – we have many new players and numbered 65 or more musicians on stage at each concert. Our <span style="color:blue">general membership is also increasing</span> 
        and perhaps reflecting this trend (and the increasing workload) we now have an enthusiastic management committee that is twelve strong.<br><br>
        The 2012 concert season was very varied. The March concert was <span style="color:blue">conducted by</span> our artistic director <span style="color:blue">Richard McIntyre</span> and was Russian themed – <span style="color:blue">Prokopiev, 
        Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky</span>. It <span style="color:blue">featured Edwina George – the 2011 Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition winner as violin soloist</span> and we also 
        had <span style="color:blue">Sebastien Lipman from Brisbane on harp</span>.<br><br>
        In August we had our first concert with <span style="color:blue">Mario Dobernig conducting</span>. Mario has been rehearsing the orchestra for the last couple of days and will 
        conduct the coming March concert and also the two musical interludes which we have for you today.<br><br>
        The concert last August featured <span style="color:blue">Beethoven’s Emperor Concerto with Raymond Yong on piano and also the New World Symphony</span>. It was an excellent 
        performance, very well received by the audience who insisted on an encore.<br><br>
        The November concert was <span style="color:blue">James Morrison Latin Fiesta</span>. This concert was <span style="color:blue">dreamed</span> up by <span style="color:blue">James Morrison and conductor Sean O’Boyle</span> but is reworked for 
        each performance and had previously been performed with the Queensland, Tasmanian and West Australian Orchestras. Our performance is the only one 
        with a community orchestra. The concert was great fun for both the orchestra and the large audience. It was also particularly pleasing to welcome 
        ten members of 1RAR band who joined us as musical partners in this performance. </p>
      <p class="pmid"> <strong>2013</strong><br>
        In 2013 we staged three successful concerts with a total audience of 1200 patrons. In March the “<span style="color:blue">Works of Art</span>” concert was a sellout at Riverway. 
        <span style="color:blue">Mussorgsky, Strauss and Haydn with conductor Mario Dobernig</span> was well received by an appreciative audience.<br><br>
        In August we had the well named “<span style="color:blue">Contrasts</span>” concert with <span style="color:blue">conductor Raymond Yong</span> and a program varying from Beethoven to Sculthorpe and featuring 
        <span style="color:blue">Elgar’s Cello Concerto</span> with Australian Concerto and Vocal <span style="color:blue">Competition winner Yoshika Masuda</span>. This concert was also presented at the Burdekin Theatre, 
        our first performance at another centre for many years. The concert was also notable for our <span style="color:blue">collaboration with Umbrella Studio and ABC Open</span> which 
        resulted in a photo artists group forming to produce a video of images to accompany Schulthorpe’s Mangrove.<br><br>
        We provided an ensemble to play at Anzac Park in September as part of the <span style="color:blue">Bandstand Centenary event</span> and then in October we presented <span style="color:blue">Hats off to 
        Gilbert and Sullivan</span>. This was a quite demanding production devised and conducted by <span style="color:blue">Richard McIntyre</span> and involved 80 singers from North Queensland 
        Opera and Music Theatre and <span style="color:blue">Townsville Choral Society</span>. The chorus combined with a sizable orchestra well and truly filled the Civic stage for what 
        was essentially a <span style="color:blue">Gilbert and Sullivan tribute show</span> featuring excerpts from three operettas tied together by a narrator.<br><br>
        2013 saw us maintain our membership numbers and our financial position remained strong. We cover approximately 60% of our expenditure from box office 
        income (which is considered to be very good by not-for-profit arts organisation standards) and the remainder is covered by grants, sponsorship and 
        philanthropy.<br><br>
        <span style="color:blue">Townsville City Council</span> continues to be our <span style="color:blue">principal sponsor</span> with a generous grant that covers our on-going core operational expenses. The <span style="color:blue">Wheeler 
        Family Charitable Gift Fund</span> has also <span style="color:blue">continued its strong support</span> and it was pleasing to welcome <span style="color:blue">Wilmar Sugar as a new sponsor</span> in 2013. Wilmar are 
        supporting us in our Burdekin performance initiative. Great in-kind support has continued from <span style="color:blue">Sturt Business Centre, ASAP Printers, Signs of 
        Excellence and the Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition</span>.<br><br>
        A new fund raising approach in 2013 was our Benefactors appeal. This has had a good start with 17 benefactors currently enrolled and the first 
        renewals about to commence. I believe this particular avenue of fund raising will strengthen over time and prove to be a very reliable source of 
        income provided it is proactively managed.<br><br>
        2013 saw our first <span style="color:blue">encouragement awards</span>. Two young orchestra members – <span style="color:blue">Craig Land and Lexie Gorton</span> – each received a well deserved $500 award in 
        recognition of their enthusiastic participation in the orchestra and their musical development. I am pleased that the committee is continuing the 
        encouragement awards in 2014. </p>
      <p class="pbot"> <strong>2014</strong><br>
        I would like to thank all the players who together produced such excellent performances in 2013. Our audience is growing and the quality of our 
        concerts is certainly one of the reasons for this. I would also like to acknowledge the hard working committee who do so much behind the scenes. 
        Particular thanks are due to <span style="color:blue">Alan Nixon</span> who is now retiring after seven years as <span style="color:blue">Secretary</span> and to <span style="color:blue">Annette Ellis</span> who has been <span style="color:blue">Treasurer</span> for seven 
        years and is continuing in that position. Special mention must also be made of <span style="color:blue">Stephen Frewen-Lord</span>’s continuing role as <span style="color:blue">Concert Master</span> and the 
        tireless efforts of several rehearsal conductors.<br><br>
        As I am now retiring as President this is my last report. Over the last five years it has been gratifying to see the Barrier Reef Orchestra make 
        considerable progress. In 2009 the orchestra was in the doldrums. It was drawing an audience of 150 or less, had less than $10,000 in cash reserves 
        and performed as an orchestra of about 40 players. In fact the mid year concert in 2009 was cancelled because we simply could not muster the players 
        required for the concert program. We are now drawing a audience of 300 to 400 if not more, have cash reserves around $70,000 and field an orchestra 
        of 60 to 70 players, depending on the program. We have also had a paid manager for several years and our current <span style="color:blue">manager Sally Frewen-Lord has 
        achieved organisational wonders</span>. This transformation has occurred only because of the great effort that has been put in over years by managers, 
        members both playing and non-playing, by committee members and by sponsors, supporters and philanthropists, so it is very much a team effort.<br><br>
        I am confident that this enthusiasm and support will continue under <span style="color:blue">Andrew Ryder’s presidency</span> and the orchestra will retain and enhance its position 
        as one of the leading organizations in Townsville’s arts community. </p>
