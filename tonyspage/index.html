		<h1>The Barrier Reef Orchestra - A North Queensland Icon</h1>
		<img src="./images/townsville-council-logo.jpg" alt="townsville city council logo">
		<p>
		We want to share our experiences with so many of our younger generation of upcoming musicians and volunteers. We invite you to join our company using 
		the form link above and come along to the practices where you will sit amongst our volunteers on the stage and experience first hand 
		what is involved in	being part of a dedicated orchestral performance.
		<p>
		Fast becoming one of North Queensland’s cultural jewels the Barrier Reef Orchestra this year launches 
		its 15th year of performing orchestral music throughout North Queensland. A community orchestra consisting 
		of the finest musicians drawn from as far afield as Cairns and Mackay, it focuses on unique orchestral juxtapositions.
		</p>
		<p>
		An outstanding performance of Beethoven’s 9th Symphony presented to a sell-out audience was recently followed by Peter 
		Sculthorpe’s Mangroves, a collaboration with audio-visual artists, ABC radio and Umbrella Studios. The programs are 
		testament to the orchestra’s willingness to embrace mainstream classical repertoire as well as opportunities for collaboration.
		<p/>
		<p>
		In 2015 the orchestra has been invited to perform in three festivals, and features in the Townsville Civic Theatre season. 
		This is a first for the orchestra - underscoring its value to the community and highlighting its continued prominence in 
		the cultural soundscape of North Queensland.
