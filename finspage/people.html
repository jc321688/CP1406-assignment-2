			considerable breadth and diversity on his work at the ANU School of Music for over a quarter of a century. One of Australia’s most respected and 
			successful bassoon teachers at all levels, his teaching places great emphasis on the establishment of a close personal relationship with each

			effect, and the various musical functions which the bassoon fulfils in varied styles and repertoires. This approach has yielded a remarkably 
			high proportion of graduates who have established successful full-time careers as professional musicians both within Australia and overseas, 
			as members of prominent orchestras, free-lancers, specialists in historically-informed performance on period instruments, instrumental teachers

			abroad. He has been Guest Principal and concerto soloist with the SSO and other Symphony Australia orchestras, the Australian Chamber Orchestra 
			and has performed with the Australia Ensemble and numerous other prominent chamber groups. His association with the Canberra Symphony Orchestra 
			as its Principal Bassoonist dates back to 1965. His recital repertoire has included works from the 16th century to the multiphonic avant-garde. 
			Richard’s teaching endeavour has extended throughout Australia and into Asia, and has included much work with Youth Music Australia and its 
			predecessors over some 30 years. He has contributed significantly to the bassoon’s pedagogic repertoire with numerous transcriptions and 
			arrangements, and has won high international acclaim for his monumental arrangements of large-scale orchestral works for The Canberra Wind 
			Soloists, giving them a distinctively unique repertoire. His work as a youth orchestra conductor has yielded Canberran of the Year, Sounds
