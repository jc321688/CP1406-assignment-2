		<h1>The Barrier Reef Orchestra - A North Queensland Icon</h1>
		<p>
		Fast becoming one of North Queensland’s cultural jewels the Barrier Reef Orchestra this year launches 
		its 15th year of performing orchestral music throughout North Queensland. A community orchestra consisting 
		of the finest musicians drawn from as far afield as Cairns and Mackay, it focuses on unique orchestral juxtapositions.
		</p>
		<p>
		An outstanding performance of Beethoven’s 9th Symphony presented to a sell-out audience was recently followed by Peter 
		Sculthorpe’s Mangroves, a collaboration with audio-visual artists, ABC radio and Umbrella Studios. The programs are 
		testament to the orchestra’s willingness to embrace mainstream classical repertoire as well as opportunities for collaboration.
		<p/>
		<p>
		In 2015 the orchestra has been invited to perform in three festivals, and features in the Townsville Civic Theatre season. 
		This is a first for the orchestra - underscoring its value to the community and highlighting its continued prominence in 
		the cultural soundscape of North Queensland.
